# Changing the layout

When you first connect, `cy` creates a new **pane** and attaches to it.

By default, `cy` centers the pane and fills the rest of the horizontal space with a patterned background it calls the [**frame**](/frames.md). If your terminal is smaller than the minimum number of columns (80 by default), `cy` will not show a background.

`cy` refers to the configuration of the content shown on your screen as the [**layout**](/layouts.md). Unlike `tmux`, every client on the `cy` server has their own layout that can be configured independently of other clients. In other words, only panes are shared between clients, their presentation is not.

The layout shown above has a single pane that has its horizontal size fixed to 80 columns.

### Panes and splits

{{story cast quick-start/layout --width 120 --height 26}}

`cy`'s has pane and split functionality that should feel familiar to users of tmux. Like other terminal multiplexers, in `cy` you can divide your screen up into any number of panes. This can be done with {{bind :root ctrl+a -}} to split the current pane along a horizontal line and {{bind :root ctrl+a |}} to split along a vertical one.

After creating a few, you can move between them using directional keys:

- {{bind :root ctrl+a K}} or {{bind :root ctrl+a up}} to move up
- {{bind :root ctrl+a J}} or {{bind :root ctrl+a down}} to move down
- {{bind :root ctrl+a H}} or {{bind :root ctrl+a left}} to move left
- {{bind :root ctrl+a L}} or {{bind :root ctrl+a right}} to move right

### Tabs

{{story cast layout/tabs}}

`cy` also has tabs:

- {{bind :root ctrl+a t}} to create a new tab
- {{bind :root ctrl+a R}} to rename the current tab
- {{bind :root ctrl+a tab}} to move to the next tab
- {{bind :root ctrl+a shift+tab}} to move to the previous tab
- {{api action/close-tab}} to close the current tab

### Removing panes

You can visually remove panes from your layout with {{bind :root ctrl+a x}}. However, it is important to note that unlike in other terminal multiplexers, removing a pane from your layout does not kill it; you can still attach to it again, such as by using {{bind :root ctrl+a ;}}. In `cy`'s lexicon, the pane is still in your node tree. To remove a pane both from the node tree and the layout, you can use {{bind :root ctrl+a X}}.

### Margins

The outer margins can be adjusted or disabled with a few keybindings. Note that **these will only have an effect if your terminal is wider than 80 columns and the margins are visible.**

1. To make the inner pane fill the entire viewport, type {{bind :root ctrl+a g}}.
1. To set the width of the inner pane to 80 columns, type {{bind :root ctrl+a 1}}.
1. To set it to 160 columns, type {{bind :root ctrl+a 2}}.
