{{story cast input}}

> The above uses both fuzzy finding and freeform text input.

`cy` has several API functions that solicit input from the user:

- {{api input/find}}: A fully-featured fuzzy finder for selecting one item from a list.
- {{api input/text}}: A freeform text input field for general user input.
- {{api input/thumbs}}: An implementation of "thumbs" that lets the user quickly select text on the screen.
