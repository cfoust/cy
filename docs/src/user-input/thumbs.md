# Thumbs

{{story cast input/thumbs --width 120}}

You can prompt the user to select text on the screen matching preset patterns using the {{api input/thumbs}} function. This is similar to the functionality offered by [tmux-thumbs](https://github.com/fcsonline/tmux-thumbs) or [tmux-fingers](https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers/). An action using this is bound by default to {{bind :root ctrl+a f}}.
