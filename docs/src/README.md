**cy** is an experimental terminal multiplexer. It builds on the traditional paradigms of `tmux` and `screen` with advances in form, function, and customization.

Key features:

- [Replay and search through](/replay-mode.md) any terminal session
- [Shell command history](/command-history.md) that lets you insert (and [revisit](/command-history/ctrl+r.md#ctrlr)) any command you've ever run
- [Flexible configuration](/configuration.md) with [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/), a simple imperative programming language
- Built-in [fuzzy finding](/user-input/fuzzy-finding.md) with fast, intuitive matching
